    <description><![CDATA[CONCERNED ABOUT WAR CRIMINALS ON CAMPUS? JOIN UOG FOR PALESTINE IN PROTEST AS WE DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY.

— SHARE WIDELY —

Last Wednesday and for the second time this year, the CSA accredited student group ‘Students Supporting ‘israel’’ virtually hosted two IOF war criminals as part of a North American Zionist propaganda campaign. This ‘speaking tour’ is meant to dehumanise Palestinians, humanise their killers, and to trivialise and make fun of the ‘israeli’ genocide on Gaza. Join us and several other student groups as we demand accountability from the CSA for SSI’s reprehensible actions.

Please also support our comrades at SJP TMU by emailing TMU admin (seen as the action at the end of the video on the third slide) by visiting @sjptmu page (link in their bio).

DATE: Wednesday, November 12th
TIME: 5:45PM
LOCATION: The People’s Plaza for Palestine (formerly Branion Plaza)]]></description>

What’s Happening?
Six student teams will take the stage to pitch their visionary projects aimed at solving real issues on campus, to our panel of judges in a live competition. They’re not just pitching, they’re competing for funding, mentorship, and the opportunity to make a lasting impact on our student community.
What’s in it for you?

    Witness real innovation as students present transformative ideas for campus life.
    Be inspired by the passion and creativity of your peers.
    Support a student-led movement to create meaningful change.
    Enjoy free refreshments, networking opportunities, and the chance to win a $100 door prize!

Seats are limited, RSVP now. Don’t just let history happen – be part of it.
Curious what it’s like? Check out last year’s highlights to see how student changemakers brought their ideas to life.

    <title>Women’s Centre X Glow Centre Chest Casting Workshop</title>
    <link>https://wusa.ca/event/chest-casting/</link>
    <description><![CDATA[Join the Women’s Centre and Glow on Friday, November 21 in the Women’s Centre (SLC 3104) for an event celebrating your body in a safe environment! Create a plaster cast of your chest as a way to honour and connect with your body.

No matter the size and shape of your bust, every woman-identifying person and non-binary-identifying person is welcome at the event!  

There will also be a discussion on the sexualization and feminization of chests, and how these narratives can perpetuate transphobia and body image issues. Together, we’ll explore new ways of seeing our bodies to help foster more positive and affirming self-perception.

Three FREE sessions are available:
11AM – 12 PM
1 PM – 2 PM
3 PM – 4 PM* Glow Centre – run session

Registration will be open from November 3 through November 21 at 3 p.m., or until all available spots are filled.
Please register early to secure your place using the link below!

⚠️ Accessibility, Comfort & Health Notice

This is a messy craft activity using paper mâché materials, so please wear clothes you don’t mind getting dirty.

Participants will remove clothing from their upper body in a small, private group setting (about 10 people). We understand this can feel vulnerable — please know it’s a safe and body-positive space, and you can opt out or pause at any time.

If you have allergies, skin sensitivities, or accessibility needs, please contact us in advance so we can make accommodations.

This event is exclusive to Waterloo undergrad students.]]></description>
