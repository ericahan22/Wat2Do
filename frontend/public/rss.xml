Curious about where an ActSci degree can take you beyond the traditional path? Meet Tom Miller — a UW alum who started as an actuary, earned his FSA in 2019, pivoted into consulting, and now works at a startup using data to tackle the addiction crisis. Tom’s career spans technical modeling, client-facing strategy work, and mission-driven product building, and he’s excited to talk candidly about what he’s learned along the way.

📍 MC 4041 📅 Nov 4 🕔 5:00 – 7:00 PM

What you’ll get from this session:
* How to leverage actuarial skills to move into consulting and startups

    <title>Applying Mathematical Models to Vaccination and Epidemiology</title>
    <link>https://www.instagram.com/p/DQVq5PGDlvR/</link>
    <description><![CDATA[Our first AMATH Prof Talk of the term is coming up soon!

Title: Applying Mathematical Models to Vaccination and Epidemiology
Speaker: Prof. Chris Bauch
Abstract: Vaccine refusal has enabled previously eliminated infectious diseases--such as measles and pertussis--to re-emerge in many populations. Vaccine refusal is driven by many factors, one of which is the presence or absence of the infectious disease that the vaccine itself prevents. This suggests that disease spread and vaccine decision-making are, in fact, two parts of a single coupled system of behaviour-disease interactions. Mathematical models have a long history of application in the population biology of human pathogens, including pediatric infectious diseases, and they are increasingly applied to coupled behaviour-disease interactions as well. In this talk I will give an overview of some simple mathematical models of vaccine refusal for pediatric infectious diseases, including a discussion of what they predict and how well they match up with observational data. I will also discuss extensions of these models to the COVID pandemic.

Pizza and refreshments available for PMC members.]]></description>

    <title>Law and Economics: Rational and Objective or Fundamentally Unjust?</title>
    <link>https://www.instagram.com/p/DQW_iBgDTrM/</link>
    <description><![CDATA[We are happy to announce our Philosophy Talk of the term presented by Professor Patricia Marino, Law and economics: rational and objective or fundamentally unjust?

WHEN: Wednesday November 5th at 5pm 
WHERE: Hagey Hall Room 345
DESCRIPTION:
Law and economics is the application of economic theory to legal reasoning: in this increasingly influential approach, laws are understood not in terms of justice and rights, but rather as efficient solutions to the problems of organizing society. In normative law and economics, the aim of the legal system is to maximize social welfare. Normative law and economics thus echoes the ethical theory of utilitarianism, where the right action is the one that produces the best consequences. Like utilitarianism, law and economics reasoning faces challenges to do with ethical values such as justice, fairness, and equality: what if the best consequences sacrifice some people's interests for the good of others, increase inequality, or violate other ethical norms? In this talk, I showcase these problems through examples related to tax policy, environmental injustice, and health care resource allocation; I then explain how proponents of law and economics respond to these challenges. We can then discuss together whether law and economics is a rational, objective alternative to arbitrary decision-making or whether its recommendations can be fundamentally unjust.

Snacks and drinks will be provided. This talk is open to all members of the UW community, no experience or expertise in philosophy required. We hope to see you there for an interesting philosophy talk and discussion on philosophy of economics!]]></description>
