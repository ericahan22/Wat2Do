    <title>Law and Economics: Rational and Objective or Fundamentally Unjust?</title>
    <link>https://www.instagram.com/p/DQW_iBgDTrM/</link>
    <description><![CDATA[We are happy to announce our Philosophy Talk of the term presented by Professor Patricia Marino, Law and economics: rational and objective or fundamentally unjust?

WHEN: Wednesday November 5th at 5pm 
WHERE: Hagey Hall Room 345
DESCRIPTION:
Law and economics is the application of economic theory to legal reasoning: in this increasingly influential approach, laws are understood not in terms of justice and rights, but rather as efficient solutions to the problems of organizing society. In normative law and economics, the aim of the legal system is to maximize social welfare. Normative law and economics thus echoes the ethical theory of utilitarianism, where the right action is the one that produces the best consequences. Like utilitarianism, law and economics reasoning faces challenges to do with ethical values such as justice, fairness, and equality: what if the best consequences sacrifice some people's interests for the good of others, increase inequality, or violate other ethical norms? In this talk, I showcase these problems through examples related to tax policy, environmental injustice, and health care resource allocation; I then explain how proponents of law and economics respond to these challenges. We can then discuss together whether law and economics is a rational, objective alternative to arbitrary decision-making or whether its recommendations can be fundamentally unjust.

Snacks and drinks will be provided. This talk is open to all members of the UW community, no experience or expertise in philosophy required. We hope to see you there for an interesting philosophy talk and discussion on philosophy of economics!]]></description>

WUSA recognizes that
much of
the work we do happens on the
traditional territory of the neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. The land we work on is covered by
the
LINK: Betweenthe Lakes Treaty, No. 3 (1792)  -> https://www.ontario.ca/page/map-ontario-treaties-and-reserves
Between
the Lakes Treaty, No. 3 (1792)
, and this region is still home to First Nation, Inuit, and Metis peoples from across Turtle Island. We are grateful to have the opportunity to work, play and live on this land and ackno
wledge that it is our collective responsibility to make our community and world a better place for all people. We acknowledge that educational institutions have not been a safe space for Indigenous students in the past and we continue to work to ensure that this is no longer the case.
The work towards truth and reconciliation is ongoing, please do your part and take time to learn more:

WUSA recognizes that
much of
the work we do happens on the
traditional territory of the neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. The land we work on is covered by
the
LINK: Betweenthe Lakes Treaty, No. 3 (1792)  -> https://www.ontario.ca/page/map-ontario-treaties-and-reserves
Between the Lakes Treaty, No. 3 (1792)
, and this region is still home to First Nation, Inuit, and Metis peoples from across Turtle Island. We are grateful to have the opportunity to work, play and live on this land and ackno
wledge that it is our collective responsibility to make our community and world a better place for all people. We acknowledge that educational institutions have not been a safe space for Indigenous students in the past and we continue to work to ensure that this is no longer the case.
The work towards truth and reconciliation is ongoing, please do your part and take time to learn more:

    WUSA recognizes that
    much of
    the work we do happens on the
    traditional territory of the neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. The land we work on is covered by
    the
    LINK: Betweenthe Lakes Treaty, No. 3 (1792)  -> https://www.ontario.ca/page/map-ontario-treaties-and-reserves
    Between
    the Lakes Treaty, No. 3 (1792)
    , and this region is still home to First Nation, Inuit, and Metis peoples from across Turtle Island. We are grateful to have the opportunity to work, play and live on this land and ackno
    wledge that it is our collective responsibility to make our community and world a better place for all people. We acknowledge that educational institutions have not been a safe space for Indigenous students in the past and we continue to work to ensure that this is no longer the case.
    The work towards truth and reconciliation is ongoing, please do your part and take time to learn more:

WUSA recognizes that
much of
the work we do happens on the
traditional territory of the neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. The land we work on is covered by
the

Between
the Lakes Treaty, No. 3 (1792)
, and this region is still home to First Nation, Inuit, and Metis peoples from across Turtle Island. We are grateful to have the opportunity to work, play and live on this land and ackno
wledge that it is our collective responsibility to make our community and world a better place for all people. We acknowledge that educational institutions have not been a safe space for Indigenous students in the past and we continue to work to ensure that this is no longer the case.
The work towards truth and reconciliation is ongoing, please do your part and take time to learn more:

WUSA recognizes that
much of
the work we do happens on the
traditional territory of the neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. The land we work on is covered by
the
LINK: Betweenthe Lakes Treaty, No. 3 (1792)  -> https://www.ontario.ca/page/map-ontario-treaties-and-reserves
Between
the Lakes Treaty, No. 3 (1792)
, and this region is still home to First Nation, Inuit, and Metis peoples from across Turtle Island. We are grateful to have the opportunity to work, play and live on this land and ackno
wledge that it is our collective responsibility to make our community and world a better place for all people. We acknowledge that educational institutions have not been a safe space for Indigenous students in the past and we continue to work to ensure that this is no longer the case.
The work towards truth and reconciliation is ongoing, please do your part and take time to learn more:

WUSA recognizes that
much of
the work we do happens on the
traditional territory of the neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. The land we work on is covered by
the

Between
the Lakes Treaty, No. 3 (1792)
, and this region is still home to First Nation, Inuit, and Metis peoples from across Turtle Island. We are grateful to have the opportunity to work, play and live on this land and ackno
wledge that it is our collective responsibility to make our community and world a better place for all people. We acknowledge that educational institutions have not been a safe space for Indigenous students in the past and we continue to work to ensure that this is no longer the case.
The work towards truth and reconciliation is ongoing, please do your part and take time to learn more:

    STRICT CONTENT POLICY:
    - ONLY extract an event if the post is clearly announcing or describing a real-world event with BOTH:
        * a specific date (e.g., "October 31", "Friday", "tomorrow")
        * AND a specific start time (e.g., "at 2pm", "from 10am-4pm", "noon", "evening").
    - DO NOT extract an event if there is no explicit mention of a start time. Do NOT default to midnight or any other time if none is given.
    - DO NOT extract an event if:
        * The post is a meme, personal photo dump, or generic post with no time/place.
        * The post is inappropriate (nudity, explicit sexual content, or graphic violence).
        * There is no explicit mention of BOTH a date (e.g., "October 31", "Friday", "tomorrow") AND a time (e.g., "at 2pm", "from 10am-4pm", "noon", "evening") in the caption or image.
        * The post only introduces people or some topic, UNLESS there is a clear call to attend or participate in an actual event (such as a meeting, workshop, performance, or competition).

    If you determine that there is NO event in the post, return the JSON value: null (not an object, not an array, just the literal null). Otherwise, return an array of JSON objects with ALL of the following fields:
    {
        "title": string,
        "dtstart": string,            // local start in "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+HH"
        "dtend": string,              // local end in "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+HH" or empty string
        "dtstart_utc": string,        // UTC start "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SSZ" or empty string
        "dtend_utc": string,          // UTC end "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SSZ" or empty string
        "duration": string,           // "HH:MM:SS" or empty string
        "all_day": boolean,
        "location": string,
        "latitude": number or null,
        "longitude": number or null,
        "tz": string,
        "price": number or null,
        "food": string,
        "registration": boolean,
        "rrule": string,
        "rdate": string,              // comma-separated datetime strings in format "YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS,YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS,..." (e.g., "20251113T170000,20251204T170000,20251218T170000")
        "school": string,
        "source_image_url": string,
        "description": string,
        "categories": list            // one or more of the following, as a JSON array of strings: - Academic
- Career & Networking
- Social & Games
- Athletics
- Creative Arts
- Cultural
- Religious
- Advocacy & Causes
- Sales & Fundraising
    }

    CONSOLIDATION RULES (VERY IMPORTANT):
    - If multiple dates/times describe the SAME event (same title/location/content), CONSOLIDATE into ONE object:
        * Put the primary occurrence in dtstart/dtend.
        * For additional dates: use EITHER rdate (for specific dates without a pattern) OR rrule (for a clear recurring pattern like "every Monday").
        * IMPORTANT: Use EITHER rrule OR rdate, NEVER both. If using rdate, set rrule to "". If using rrule, set rdate to "".
        * Never create separate objects for the same event just because of multiple dates.
    - Only create multiple objects when the caption clearly describes DISTINCT events (different titles, venues, or clearly different activities).

    RDATE vs RRULE RULES (CRITICAL):
    
    MUTUAL EXCLUSIVITY (MANDATORY):
    - RRULE and RDATE are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE - you must use EITHER one OR the other, NEVER both.
    - If an event has multiple specific dates with NO recurring pattern, use RDATE only (rrule must be "").
    - If an event has a recurring pattern (e.g., "every Monday", "weekly on Wednesdays", "daily"), use RRULE only (rdate must be "").
    - If an event has no recurrence or additional dates, both rrule and rdate should be empty strings "".

    - Use RDATE when multiple specific dates are listed but NO recurring pattern is explicitly stated:
        * Example: "Join us Oct 15, Oct 22, Nov 3, and Nov 10" -> Use RDATE with the additional dates, rrule must be ""
        * RDATE should be a comma-separated string of datetime values in format YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS
        * Example: "20251022T140000,20251103T140000,20251110T140000"
        * Put the first occurrence in dtstart/dtend, remaining dates/times in rdate
        * When using RDATE, always set rrule to ""
    
    - Use RRULE when a recurring pattern IS explicitly stated (e.g., "every Monday", "weekly on Wednesdays", "daily"):
    * DO NOT USE RRULE IF THE EVENT HAS NO RECURRING PATTERN
        * RRULE MUST include the UNTIL parameter to specify when the recurrence ends
        * Format: FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO;UNTIL=20251231T235959Z
        * If no end date is mentioned, use 20251231T235959Z as the UNTIL value
        * Common RRULE examples:
            - Every Wednesday until December: FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=WE;UNTIL=20251130T235959Z
            - Daily for a week: FREQ=DAILY;UNTIL=20251110T235959Z
            - Every Tuesday and Thursday: FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=TU,TH;UNTIL=20251215T235959Z
        * When using RRULE, always set rdate to ""

    MULTIPLE TIME SLOTS FOR SAME RECURRING EVENT:
    When the same event has multiple time slots on the same day(s) of the week, create SEPARATE event objects for each time slot.
    Example: "Weekly sessions every Wednesday: 5-6 PM and 8-10 PM through December"
    Should create TWO event objects:
    [
        {
            "...": "...",
            "dtstart": "2025-11-05 17:00:00-05",
            "dtend": "2025-11-05 18:00:00-05",
            "dtstart_utc": "2025-11-05 22:00:00Z",
            "dtend_utc": "2025-11-05 23:00:00Z",
            "duration": "01:00:00",
            "all_day": false,
            "rrule": "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=WE;UNTIL=20251231T235959Z",
            "rdate": "",
        },
        {
            "...": "...",
            "dtstart": "2025-11-05 20:00:00-05",
            "dtend": "2025-11-05 22:00:00-05",
            "dtstart_utc": "2025-11-06 01:00:00Z",
            "dtend_utc": "2025-11-06 03:00:00Z",
            "duration": "02:00:00",
            "rrule": "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=WE;UNTIL=20251231T235959Z",
            "rdate": "",
        }
    ]
    This represents two separate recurring time slots (5-6 PM and 8-10 PM) on every Wednesday from November through December.

    ADDITIONAL RULES:
    - Prioritize caption text; use image text if missing details.
    - Title-case event titles.
    - If year not found, assume 2025. If end time < start time (e.g., 7pm-12am), set end to next day.
    - When no explicit date is found but there are relative terms like "tonight", "tomorrow", use the current date context and the date the post was made to determine the date.
    - Convert local times to UTC using tz for dtstart_utc/dtend_utc when available.
    - For all_day: ONLY set to true if the post **explicitly states** it is an all-day event (e.g., "all day", "full day").
    - For location: Use the exact location as stated in the caption or image. If the location is a building or room on campus, use only that (e.g., "SLC 3223", "DC Library"). Include city/province if the event is off-campus and the address is provided.
    - For latitude/longitude: attempt to geocode the location if it's a specific address or well-known place (e.g., "DC Library"). Otherwise, attempt geocoding using the school context. Use null if location is too vague or cannot be geocoded.
    - For tz mappings, default to "America/Toronto" for University of Waterloo.
    - For price: this represents REGISTRATION COST ONLY. When multiple prices are mentioned, prefer the price that applies to NON-MEMBERS (or general admission). Rules:
        * If both "non-member" / "general admission" and "member" prices appear, use the non-member/general admission numeric price.
        * If only member prices are given and non-member price is absent, use the listed member price.
        * If multiple ticket tiers are listed (e.g., "early bird" and "regular"), use the lowest applicable price (e.g., early bird price).
        * Parse dollar amounts and return a numeric value (e.g., "$15" -> 15.0). Use null for free events or when no price is mentioned.
    - For food: Only set this field if the post says food or drinks will be served, provided, or available for attendees. If specific food or beverage items are mentioned (e.g., "pizza", "bubble tea", "snacks"), list them separated by commas and capitalize ONLY the first item. If the post explicitly says food is provided but does not specify what kind (e.g., "free food", "food provided", "there will be food"), output "Yes!" (exactly). If there is no mention of food or drinks, output an empty string "".
    - For registration: only set to true if there is a clear instruction to register, RSVP, or sign up, otherwise set to false.
    - For rrule and rdate: they are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. Use EITHER rrule (for recurring patterns) OR rdate (for specific dates without a pattern), NEVER both. If using rrule, set rdate to "". If using rdate, set rrule to "".
    - For description: start with the caption text word-for-word, then append any additional insights about the event extracted from the image that are not already mentioned in the caption.
    - If information is not available, use empty string for strings, null for price/coordinates, and false for booleans.
    - Return ONLY the JSON array text, no extra commentary.]]></description>

    <title>Roundtable: Food on Campus</title>
    <link>https://wusa.ca/event/food-on-campus/</link>
    <description><![CDATA[If you’ve ever said “$18 for that plate???” …this roundtable is for you. Eating on campus shouldn’t feel like a budgeting crisis. Whether you’re grabbing something between classes or looking for a real meal, students deserve food that’s affordable, nutritious, and actually satisfying. We want to hear: What’s working with food options on campus? What’s frustrating (price, quality, variety, lines)? What would make eating here better for everyone? Your experiences help WUSA advocate for changes that put students first. 🍕 Free pizza for the first 30 attendees. PS: If you’re currently struggling to afford food, WUSA offers support through the Food Support Service and Pay-What-You-Can Program. Learn more at wusa.ca/food.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Come join us for an AMATH Prof Talk on neural networks and dynamical systems!

Abstract: In machine learning, neural networks are often used in a feed-forward manner. Or, when a population of neurons is recurrently connected, the updates happen in synchronized jumps. But the neurons in your brain are operating in continuous time. I will show you some ways to bridge the gap to biology, and treat networks of interconnected neurons as a dynamical system. Then, we'll co-opt those networks to do our bidding, and get them to solve dynamical systems.

Pizza and refreshments will be provided to PMC members.]]></description>

Performances are held on November 20th and November 21st at the Humanities Theatre, doors open at 6:30 pm. Heckling is encouraged. Enjoy at your own risk.

No matter the size and shape of your bust, every woman-identifying person and non-binary-identifying person is welcome at the event!

Registration will be open from November 3 through November 21 at 3 p.m., or until all available spots are filled. Please register early to secure your place using the link below!]]></description>

    <title>Voices Empower Walk</title>

    <description><![CDATA[Join us for the Voices Empower Walk on November 22. Meet at the UWaterloo ION Station at 12:20 PM or at Uptown Square before 1 PM. The event runs from 1–4 PM. Everyone is welcome. Every six days in Canada, a woman is killed by her intimate partner. In 2024 alone, 187 femicides were recorded nationwide 62 in Ontario between November 2023 and November 2024. This rise in violence demands action. We cannot stay silent. When we walk together, we honor those lost, stand with survivors, and raise funds to help women, gender-diverse people, and children move beyond violence. Together, we walk for change. 💜]]></description>
