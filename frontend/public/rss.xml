    <title>Law and Economics: Rational and Objective or Fundamentally Unjust?</title>
    <link>https://www.instagram.com/p/DQW_iBgDTrM/</link>
    <description><![CDATA[We are happy to announce our Philosophy Talk of the term presented by Professor Patricia Marino, Law and economics: rational and objective or fundamentally unjust?

WHEN: Wednesday November 5th at 5pm 
WHERE: Hagey Hall Room 345
DESCRIPTION:
Law and economics is the application of economic theory to legal reasoning: in this increasingly influential approach, laws are understood not in terms of justice and rights, but rather as efficient solutions to the problems of organizing society. In normative law and economics, the aim of the legal system is to maximize social welfare. Normative law and economics thus echoes the ethical theory of utilitarianism, where the right action is the one that produces the best consequences. Like utilitarianism, law and economics reasoning faces challenges to do with ethical values such as justice, fairness, and equality: what if the best consequences sacrifice some people's interests for the good of others, increase inequality, or violate other ethical norms? In this talk, I showcase these problems through examples related to tax policy, environmental injustice, and health care resource allocation; I then explain how proponents of law and economics respond to these challenges. We can then discuss together whether law and economics is a rational, objective alternative to arbitrary decision-making or whether its recommendations can be fundamentally unjust.

Snacks and drinks will be provided. This talk is open to all members of the UW community, no experience or expertise in philosophy required. We hope to see you there for an interesting philosophy talk and discussion on philosophy of economics!]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Come join us for an AMATH Prof Talk on neural networks and dynamical systems!

Abstract: In machine learning, neural networks are often used in a feed-forward manner. Or, when a population of neurons is recurrently connected, the updates happen in synchronized jumps. But the neurons in your brain are operating in continuous time. I will show you some ways to bridge the gap to biology, and treat networks of interconnected neurons as a dynamical system. Then, we'll co-opt those networks to do our bidding, and get them to solve dynamical systems.

Pizza and refreshments will be provided to PMC members.]]></description>

Peter Johnson discovers he's not like everyone else, and he and his friends embark on a harrowing journey of self-discovery, hijinks, and a little bit of debauchery to prevent a war among the Eng-gods. Performances are held on November 20th and November 21st at the Humanities Theatre, doors open at 6:30 pm. Heckling is encouraged. Enjoy at your own risk.

    <description><![CDATA[Join us for the Voices Empower Walk on November 22. Meet at the UWaterloo ION Station at 12:20 PM or at Uptown Square before 1 PM. The event runs from 1–4 PM. Everyone is welcome. Every six days in Canada, a woman is killed by her intimate partner. In 2024 alone, 187 femicides were recorded nationwide 62 in Ontario between November 2023 and November 2024. This rise in violence demands action. We cannot stay silent. When we walk together, we honor those lost, stand with survivors, and raise funds to help women, gender-diverse people, and children move beyond violence. Together, we walk for change. 💜]]></description>

By L. Frank Baum
With music and lyrics by Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg
Background music by Herbert Stothart
Dance and vocal arrangements by Peter Howard
Orchestration by Larry Wilcox
Adapted by John Kane for The Royal Shakespeare Company
Based upon the classic motion picture owned by Turner Entertainment Co. and distributed in all media by Warner Bros.
THE WIZARD OF OZ is presented by arrangement with Concord Theatricals on behalf of Tams-Witmark LLC.
LINK: www.concordtheatricals.com  -> http://www.concordtheatricals.com
.
Based on the classic 1939 film and adapted by the Royal Shakespeare Company, The Wizard of Oz remains one of the most beloved musicals of all time—featuring all the unforgettable songs, characters, and moments that have enchanted audiences for generations.
When young Dorothy Gale is swept from the Kansas prairie by a powerful tornado, she lands in the fantastical land of Oz—a world filled with magic, colour, and unexpected danger. Guided by Glinda the Good Witch and joined by a heart-seeking Tinman, a brainless Scarecrow, and a timid Lion, Dorothy embarks on a journey down the Yellow Brick Road in search of the mighty Wizard who can send her home. But the Wicked Witch of the West is never far behind…
KWMP’s production reimagines this timeless tale for a new generation — drawing from the heart of the original while infusing it with a bold, theatrical new vision. Expect the characters you love, the music you remember, and a few surprises that will ignite your imagination.
Join us as we rediscover a world where courage, heart, and friendship light the way… and there’s truly no place like home.
