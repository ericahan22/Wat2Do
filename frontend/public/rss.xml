Fans of Dragon’s Den, This One’s for You!
Do you love seeing bold ideas, creative pitches, and real solutions come to life? Then get ready to cheer for your fellow students at the Change Engine Competition where innovation meets advocacy and ideas turn into action!
Think Dragon’s Den or Shark Tank, but with the heart of Waterloo’s brightest changemakers. Watch advocacy ideas turn into real impact on campus, and maybe even spark some of your own.
What’s Happening?
Six student teams will take the stage to pitch their visionary projects aimed at solving real issues on campus, to our panel of judges in a live competition. They’re not just pitching, they’re competing for funding, mentorship, and the opportunity to make a lasting impact on our student community.
What’s in it for you?

    Witness real innovation as students present transformative ideas for campus life.
    Be inspired by the passion and creativity of your peers.
    Support a student-led movement to create meaningful change.
    Enjoy free refreshments, networking opportunities, and the chance to win a $100 door prize!

Seats are limited, RSVP now. Don’t just let history happen – be part of it.
Curious what it’s like? Check out last year’s highlights to see how student changemakers brought their ideas to life.

    <description><![CDATA[Come join us for an AMATH Prof Talk on neural networks and dynamical systems!

Abstract: In machine learning, neural networks are often used in a feed-forward manner. Or, when a population of neurons is recurrently connected, the updates happen in synchronized jumps. But the neurons in your brain are operating in continuous time. I will show you some ways to bridge the gap to biology, and treat networks of interconnected neurons as a dynamical system. Then, we'll co-opt those networks to do our bidding, and get them to solve dynamical systems.

Pizza and refreshments will be provided to PMC members.]]></description>

No matter the size and shape of your bust, every woman-identifying person and non-binary-identifying person is welcome at the event!  

There will also be a discussion on the sexualization and feminization of chests, and how these narratives can perpetuate transphobia and body image issues. Together, we’ll explore new ways of seeing our bodies to help foster more positive and affirming self-perception.

Three FREE sessions are available:
11AM – 12 PM
1 PM – 2 PM
3 PM – 4 PM* Glow Centre – run session

Registration will be open from November 3 through November 21 at 3 p.m., or until all available spots are filled.
Please register early to secure your place using the link below!

⚠️ Accessibility, Comfort & Health Notice

This is a messy craft activity using paper mâché materials, so please wear clothes you don’t mind getting dirty.

Participants will remove clothing from their upper body in a small, private group setting (about 10 people). We understand this can feel vulnerable — please know it’s a safe and body-positive space, and you can opt out or pause at any time.

If you have allergies, skin sensitivities, or accessibility needs, please contact us in advance so we can make accommodations.
