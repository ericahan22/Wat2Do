    <description><![CDATA[UW DISCLOSED, AND IT’S EVEN WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT

At more than $200 million invested, the University of Waterloo ranks among the worst university offenders of complicity in the genocide.

The students forced UW to drop Technion, and we will force the Board of Butchers to divest.

🚨 TAKE ACTION NOW 🚨
ALL OUT OCTOBER 27th: DIVEST OR WE’LL DISMANTLE

Join us on Monday, October 27th to demand divestment and a complete end to UWaterloo’s complicity in genocide and occupation.

The students demand divestment now, and we will not rest until UW divests every last dollar they have in companies aiding the Zionist entity, until UW ceases all support for genocide and occupation and until total liberation and return.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Next Monday the Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Office (SVPRO) will be joining us for the first hour of our meeting to talk about their role on campus, sexual safety, and resources available to us. SVPRO is the support system for those who have experienced sexual violence on campus and they also work to prevent it through training and awareness initiatives. You may be familiar with their 'consent week' events or 'red zone' awareness campaign (if not, this is a great time to learn about that). This is also an opportunity to ask questions or pass on feedback you might have for the university related to this topic. Also, hot chocolate will be served!! With marshmallows!! And whipped cream!! Yay!!]]></description>
